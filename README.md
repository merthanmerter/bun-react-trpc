# bun-react-trpc-template

This template is designed to help you build fullstack apps powered by **Bun**,
**React**, and **tRPC**, with a unique twist: you can **compile the entire app
into a single binary**, making it ideal for self-contained deployments.

### Ideal for:

- Internal tools and dashboards
- Intranet or local network services
- Client-side deployments without external dependencies
- Kiosk apps, embedded systems, or air-gapped environments

No need for Node.js, complex runtime environments, or even internet access â€”
just run the binary.
